# Day 3: Array Problems (Max, Min, Reverse)

## Topics Covered

- Finding maximum and minimum elements
- Reversing an array
- Practicing problem-solving on arrays

## Code Implemented

- Function to find maximum element
- Function to find minimum element
- Function to reverse an array in-place
- Reused array print function for better readability

## Problems Solved

- **GeeksforGeeks: [Find Largest Element in an Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-find-the-maximum-and-minimum-element-in-an-array/)**
- **GeeksforGeeks: [Reverse an Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/)**

## Insights

- Important to loop carefully from `0` to `n - 1` to avoid out-of-bound errors.
- Using helper functions (`printArray`, `findMax`, `findMin`) makes the main logic clean and modular.
- Reversing an array in-place avoids using extra space and is commonly asked in interviews.
