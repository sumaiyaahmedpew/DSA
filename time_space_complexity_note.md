# Day 1: Time & Space Complexity

## Concepts Covered

- **Time Complexity**: Measures how the running time of an algorithm grows with input size.
- **Space Complexity**: Measures extra memory space required by an algorithm.
- **Big O notation**: Describes the upper bound of complexity (worst-case analysis).

## Example Complexities

- **O(1)**: Constant time (e.g., accessing first element).
- **O(n)**: Linear time (e.g., finding maximum element).
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic time (e.g., printing all pairs).
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time (e.g., binary search).

## Practice

- Read GFG MCQs on Complexity: [GFG Quiz](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quiz-corner-gq/time-complexity-of-algorithms-quiz-1/)
- Implemented:
  - Get first element (O(1))
  - Find max element (O(n))
  - Print all pairs (O(n²))
  - Binary search (O(log n))

## Insights

- Analyzing loops and nested loops is critical to estimate time complexity.
- Binary search drastically reduces time complexity by dividing the problem in half at each step.
- Printing all pairs is a classic example of quadratic growth.
