# Day 2: Arrays Introduction & Traversal

## Topics Covered

- Array declaration and initialization
- Array traversal using loops
- Finding maximum and minimum
- Reversing an array

## Problems Solved

- **LeetCode: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)**
- **LeetCode: [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)**

## Code Implemented

- Print array elements
- Find maximum and minimum
- Reverse array

## Insights

- Arrays are stored in contiguous memory and allow constant-time access by index.
- Important to carefully handle indices to avoid segmentation faults or out-of-bounds errors in C.
- Reversing an array in-place is a classic technique for optimizing space.
